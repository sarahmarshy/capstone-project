### Suggestions if you want to use Python

Python is a really popular language for data science projects, and there a lot of great tools out there to use.

- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for data analysis/exploration
- [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) for writing/sharing scripts/results together
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) for machine learning/data mining

#### Setting up python environment 
Included in this repo is a ```requirements.txt``` file. That has all of the dependencies for the libraries mentioned above. With python, you can easily install all of them in one go by running 

```pip install -r install requirements.txt```

Before doing that, you'll want to make sure pip(a python package manager) is installed and updated.

It is also a common practice to keep python dependencies separate for each project by creating virutal environments. There is a great resource on how to do this [here](http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/).
